## About
Compatible Item Recommendation focuses on the analysis of relationships between products for a compatibility notion to improve recommender systems. Ex: An Intel Core i7 is only compatible with specific motherboards based on a specific processor socket. This information should be taken into account for recommendation rather than Amazon's traditional approach of co-purchase recommendation. Our completed thesis can be read at: [Compatible Item Recommendation.pdf](https://github.com/kevinjnguyen/Compatible-Item-Recommendation/raw/master/Undergraduate%20Research%20Scholars%20Thesis.pdf)


## Resources
All of our research is contained in Jupyter Notebooks and can be found under the `Notebooks` folder.  Additional resources such as our poster and category association list, can be found in the `Documents` folder.
